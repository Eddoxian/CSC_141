while loop repeats the strings of code so long as the boolean is true
boolean can only be true or false
f strings tell anything in {} to be a string and pull info.
Input() is storage oftentimes if you want to change something to a variable using int()
Lists are storage using [], the first item in a list is 0
randint picks a number between 0 and whatever the final number is
input() normally involves human intervention to work
Break means to stop a loop block
if statements are basically conditions for if something did happen
else statements are conditions for if something didnt happen with if
elif is a neater way of checking through a list of loops
dictionaries always hold key-value pairs
dictionaries use keys to look up values
dictionaries can contain lists and strings
We split among spaces to get individual words
len = length

Binary practice
1101
from right to left its 2 to the next power, every 0 is an off switch
so 1, 4, 8, which = 13

110011
which is 32, 16, 2, 1 which is 51

Turning decimal to a Binary
37 = 100101

94 = 1011110

Binaries are always powers of 2
